         <strong>CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY</strong> 
         <img class= "imgfloat" src="tim-meyer-X-3CqrZd6R0-unsplash.jpg" alt="image of a parking lot" >
         A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber
         
         All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end
         
         A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy
         
                CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is
         
         He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo
         
         The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off
         
         The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours
         
                FATHER: How was camp?
         
         The Boy "shrugs"
         
                FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?
         
                THE BOY: No
         
         The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh
                FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight
         
                THE BOY: Frito pie
         
                FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-
         
                THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie,

         
         Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window<hr>
         
         <strong>EXT. MANSION - DAY</strong> 
         
         The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic
         
         <strong>INT. MANSION - DAY</strong> 
         
         An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care
         
         The Father's phone rings:
         
                FATHER: Hello
         
                PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-
         
         Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off
         The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out</p>

       <strong>INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY</strong>


         The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice

         The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics
         
         He starts checking his mail. His friend "FAM" sent him something that says "this is you" with a link. He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as "VERY HOTTTTTTT". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying
         
         "This guy sound like a broke Future! [CRYING EMOJI]" is the top comment
         
         The Boy stares. Then types "shut up" in the comments
         
         He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart
         
         He refreshes the page. People immediately responds with "You wouldn't say that to my face",
         The Boy smiles...bec a use the in t e rnet
